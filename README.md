# milkv baremetal toolkit
This is a tookit that builds ready-to-flash .img images for Milk-V duo 256M, enabling custom OS development from scratch.

I created this respository for the reason that I think the existing tutorials are not very newbie-friendly to me. This toolkit will tell you how to get all the toolchain you need and build the image in one click.

## Dependency
You should install the cross compile toolchain.
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```
## Usage
**Notice: For the convenience reason, I use some pre-build binaries. However, if you don't want to use the pre-build binaries for security reason, I will write a full tutorial of how to build these binaries from source.**

First, clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rota1001/milkv-baremetal-toolkit.git
```
Second, use `make` to compile and produce the kernel image.
```shell
cd milkv-baremetal-toolkit
make
```

Then you will get the `kernel.img`, you can flash it to the SD card. It will output the `helloworld` through the UART serial port.
